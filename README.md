This repo contains [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae.

# Installation

## Elasticsearch 1.7.6
`brew install "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sevenlist/homebrew/master/elasticsearch@1.7.rb"`

This formula was taken from the official Homebrew repository ([homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/)), before it has been removed (commit [390173e](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/commit/390173e9035a2bb4b107930c11f07d31a204ea23)) as Elasticsearch 1.7 has reached its EOL. The formula has been fixed so that it can be installed with Homebrew 1.7.7.
